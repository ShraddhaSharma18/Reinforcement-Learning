Using this page to reflect on my everyday learning about ML Frameworks and reinforcement learning

What is Reinforcement learning? How is it different from supervised machine learning?
- Its a paradigm of machine learning where the model starts with zero and learns from feedback/experience through Markov Decision Process.

What are the common applications of reinforcement learning?
- Computer games
- Robotics
- AlphaGo
- 

What are the types of Reinforcement learning?
- Positive RL
- Negative RL

What is Markov Decision Process (MDP)?
- Ref: https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-demystified-markov-decision-processes-part-1-bf00dda41690
- Markov Property: "Give the present, future is independent of the past"

What is Q-Learning?
- Ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/q-learning-in-python/
- Q-Learning is a basic form of Reinforcement Learning which uses Q-values (also called action values) to iteratively improve the behavior of the learning agent

What is td-update rule?
- Ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/q-learning-in-python/
- The Temporal Difference or TD-Update rule can be represented as follows :

    Q(S,A) <- Q(S,A) , alpha(R + gamma Q(S',A') + Q(S,A))

- This update rule to estimate the value of Q is applied at every time step of the agents interaction with the environment.
