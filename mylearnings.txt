Using this page to reflect on my everyday learning about ML Frameworks and reinforcement learning

What is Reinforcement learning? How is it different from supervised machine learning?
- Its a kind of Machine learning where the model starts with zero and learns from feedback/experience through Markov Decision Process.

What are the common applications of reinforcement learning?
- Computer games
- Robotics
- AlphaGo
- 

What are the types of Reinforcement learning?
- Positive RL
- Negative RL

What is Markov Decision Process (MDP)?
- Ref: https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-demystified-markov-decision-processes-part-1-bf00dda41690
- Markov Property: "Give the present, future is independent of the past"
